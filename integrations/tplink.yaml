# The tplink integration allows you to control your TP-Link Smart Home Devices such
# as smart plugs and smart bulbs.
#
# There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:
#
# * Light
# * Switch
#
# In order to activate the support, you will have to enable the integration inside
# the configuration panel. The supported devices in your network are automatically
# discovered, but if you want to control devices residing in other networks you will
# need to configure them manually as shown below.
